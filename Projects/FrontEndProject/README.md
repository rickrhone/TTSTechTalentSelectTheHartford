### PRJ2 - Front End Project - recreate wordpress.com homepage

- **Objective:** Given the wordpress.com example site and what you've learned with HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap, mimic the example site you choose as closely as possible in the time alloted.

  - When building your version of the site, don't worry about making it exactly the same to the pixel. Instead, focus on creating the same structure, sections, text/images, etc.
  - Don't forget to utilize quick tools available to you, like Bootstrap's components.
  - **Bonus**
    - On top of matching the layout I chose to also make the website mobile responsive and functional.
