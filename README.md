## Projects

### PRJ1 - Mid Course Project - Vegas Dice Game (Java)

- **Objective:** Given the following rules for the game of dice, create a program that prints out whether you won or lost on each roll.

  - The player rolls two 6-sided dice to generate a random number between 1 and 6.
  - Rolling 7 or 11 on the first try is a WIN
  - Rolling 2, 3 or 12 on the first try is a LOSE
  - Any other roll on the first try becomes the player's POINT
  - If a player rolled POINT, the player continues to roll until one of two things happens:
    - If a player has POINT and rolls the POINT again, it is a WIN
    - If a player has POINT and rolls 7, it is a LOST

- **My Solution:**
  - **[Link to my Code](https://github.com/rickrhone/TTSTechTalentSelectTheHartford/tree/master/Projects/VegasDiceGame/src/main/java)**
  - **To run the game on the command line**
    - Download the jar file [HERE](https://github.com/rickrhone/TTSTechTalentSelectTheHartford/raw/master/Projects/VegasDiceGame/out/artifacts/VegasDiceGame_jar/VegasDiceGame.jar)
    - In the Command Line/Terminal navigate to the folder containing the downloaded jar file
    - Enter the following command to run the game: **java -jar VegasDiceGame.jar**
